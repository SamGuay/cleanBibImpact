# Women are cited less than expected

**WM** = **Woman** first author & **Man** last author

# Limitations in terminology
>"...the methods used for gender determination are limited to binary man and woman gender assignments. 
>
>This study design, therefore, is not well accommodated to intersex, transgender and/or nonbinary identities and incorrectly assumes that all authors can be placed into one of two categories. 
>
> Ideally, future work will be able to move beyond the gender binary"

\- Dworkin et al. (2020)

# Diversity statement template
> ... our references contain `A`% woman(first)/woman(last), `B`% man/woman, `C`% woman/man, `D`% man/man, and `E`% unknown categorization...

# Goals for the OHBM Brainhack
- [1. Manual inspection of citing papers' diversity statement](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/projects/4) (Ground truth for Goal 2)

# Good first issues

- [Manually collect citation diversity data from citing papers for 2021](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/issues/15) (part of Goal 1)

# Good first issues
- [Update manually-collected citation diversity data from citing papers for 2020](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/issues/16) (part of Goal 1)

# Good first-ish issues 
- [Find self-citations in manually-collected data](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/issues/17) (Goal 1)

# For more-experienced hackers

- [Goal 2: Assess whether citing papers have more diverse reference lists](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/projects/2)
  - Automatically list citing papers
  - Get a paper's reference list
  - Guess author genders
- [DevOps](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/projects)
  - better modularizing our code
  - testing
  - continuous integration
