Emergence of Hierarchy in Networked Endorsement Dynamics,0,arXiv:2007.04448v3,0,0,"Recent work in several fields of science has identified gender bias in citation practices—papers by women and other minorities are systematically under-cited in their fields [Mitchell et al., 2013; Dion et al., 2018; Caplar et al., 2017; Maliniak et al., 2013; Dworkin et al., 2020]. Gender bias can arise through explicit and implicit bias against a person’s known gender identity, or against a name commonly used by members of a marginalized gender identity [MacNell et al., 2015; Paludi and Strayer, 1985; Moss-Racusin et al., 2012]. In this work, we proactively sought to include relevant citations by non-male authors. We manually gender-coded the authors in the works cited according to personal acquaintance, instances of pronoun usage online, or first name. This method is limited: names and pronouns may not be indicative of gender identity; gender identity may change over time; and our manual coding is inherently subjective 10 and subject to error. We focused on the first and last authors because typically, though not always, the former is the leading researcher and the latter the senior author in the disciplines included in our references. Of the works cited in the main text, 29% had a non-male first author and 13% had a non-male last author. Of those with at least two authors, 38% had either a non-male first author or a non-male last author. This statement was modeled after those found in [Torres et al., 2020; Dworkin et al., 2020].

This method is limited in that a) names, pronouns, and social media profiles used to construct the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of gender identity and b) it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people. Second, we obtained predicted racial/ethnic category of the first and last author of each reference by databases that store the probability of a first and last name being carried by an author of color (49, 50). By this measure (and excluding self-citations), our references contain 5.06% author of color (first)/author of color(last), 15.64% white author/author of color, 16.35% author of color/white author, and 62.95% white author/white author. This method is limited in that a) names, Census entries, and Wikipedia profiles used to make the predictions may not be indicative of racial/ethnic identity, and b) it cannot account for Indigenous and mixed-race authors, or those who may face differential biases due to the ambiguous racialization or ethnicization of their names.

"The why, how, and when of representations for complex systems",1,arXiv:2006.02870,0,0,"Recent work in several fields of science has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field [63, 121, 34, 38, 198, 59].Here we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought,form of contribution, gender, and other factors. Gender bias can arise due to explicit and implicit bias against a person’s known gender as a woman, or due to explicit or implicit bias against a person carrying a name commonly used by women [118, 146, 131]. To evaluate the former (bias according to known gender),we obtained predicted gender of the first and last author of each reference using pronouns affiliated with them online or pronouns known by personal friendships; by this measure (and excluding self-citations to the first and last authors of our current paper), our references contain 45% man(first)/man(last), 12%man/woman, 11% woman/man, 13% woman/woman, 0% non-binary , and 19% unknown categorization.This method is limited in that pronouns may not be indicative of gender identity, and may not be consistent across time or environment. To evaluate the latter (bias according to a gendered name), we used databases that store the probability of a name being carried by a woman; by this measure (again excluding self-citations), our references contains 60% man/man names, 12% man/woman names, 11% woman/man names,10% woman/woman names, and 7% unknown categorization [217, 63]. This method is limited in that it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people.

Unfortunately, the fields where this citation bias has been studied do not include applied mathematics, and therefore we do not have a way to determine whether the percentages found in our paper are reflective of the field or biased in some way. Nevertheless, we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought, form of contribution, gender, and other factors. Our current paper contains references that are (first author)-(last author) approximately 60% man-man, 12% man-woman, 11% woman-man, and 14% woman-woman, after excluding self-citations.
